 and close is greater than DailySMA("length" = 50) and close is less than 1.03 * DailySMA("length" = 50) and close is greater than or equal to open and low is less than open and low is less than DailySMA("length" = 50)

#closing near high logic
and high is greater than close and (high-close)/close < 0.006
